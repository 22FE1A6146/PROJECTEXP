# Trie-Based Autocomplete System

This project implements an autocomplete system using a Trie (prefix tree) data structure. The system supports efficient word suggestions based on a given prefix and can handle large datasets of English words from the NLTK corpus.

## Features

1. **Efficient Word Insertion**: Words are inserted into the Trie, with frequency tracking.
2. **Autocomplete Suggestions**: Provides suggestions based on a given prefix, sorted by frequency.
3. **Interactive User Input**: Accepts real-time input from users and displays autocomplete suggestions.

## Requirements

The project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python library:

- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install the `nltk` library using:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Setup

1. **Download NLTK Words Corpus**: The script downloads the word list from the NLTK library. Ensure you have an active internet connection the first time you run it.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('words')
```

2. **Initialize the Trie**: Create an instance of the `Trie` class and insert words from the NLTK corpus.

```python
from nltk.corpus import words

trie = Trie()
word_list = words.words()  # Get large list of English words

for word in word_list:
    trie.insert(word.lower())  # Insert each word into the Trie
```

## Usage

### Interactive Input

Run the script to start the interactive prompt. You can enter a prefix and get autocomplete suggestions based on the current input. To exit the program, type `exit` and press Enter.

```python
print("Type a prefix to get autocomplete suggestions:")

current_prefix = ""
while True:
    try:
        current_prefix = input(f'Prefix: ')
        if current_prefix.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        suggestions = trie.autocomplete(current_prefix, max_suggestions=10)
        if suggestions:
            print(f"Autocomplete suggestions for '{current_prefix}': {suggestions}")
        else:
            print(f"No suggestions found for '{current_prefix}'")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break

print("\nExiting...")
```

### Example Output

For the prefix `"soci"`, the autocomplete suggestions might include:

```bash
Type a prefix to get autocomplete suggestions:
Prefix: soci
Autocomplete suggestions for 'soci': ['social', 'society', 'sociable', ...]
```

## How It Works

### Trie Structure

The Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character in a word. Words are stored as paths from the root node to leaf nodes. Each `TrieNode` contains:
- `children`: A `defaultdict` of child nodes.
- `is_end_of_word`: A boolean flag indicating the end of a valid word.
- `frequency`: The frequency of the word if this node marks the end of a word.

### Autocomplete Functionality

The `autocomplete` function retrieves suggestions based on a given prefix. It traverses the Trie to find all words that start with the prefix, sorts them by frequency, and returns the top suggestions.

## Extending the Code

You can extend this project by:
- **Adding More Words**: Incorporate additional datasets or word lists.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Implement more efficient algorithms or data structures.
- **Supporting Other Languages**: Adapt the Trie for multilingual support.
